            <p class="justify-content-end col-sm-6">Hello! My name is Morgaan Holmes. I grew up in Northern California and am currently living in the Bronx Borough of New York City. FOr most of my adult life all my jobs have been low pay customer servive related jobes. Upon realizing that I do not have the emotional fortitude to be working with the general publick professionally, I decided to look into other career options. During my explorations, I tried my hand at programming and realized that it was a lot more fun than I though. I also realized that I was much better at it than I thought I would be. So, after exploring some avenues, I came across Woz-U and was to their progrm. 5 years ago, I enrolled in the program, however, due to circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to finish. However, those circumstances changed two years later, and I was dedicated whole-heartedly to completing the Software Development course and beinning a lucrative career in Software Development. However, upon graduating I realized that I had made a mistake and while trying to rectify it, I wound up deleting all my work. While fixing that, I ran into some more complications beyond my control, and after another two years of trying to fix them, I am back and working on fixing all of the mistakes and dedicating myself to make up for lost time to begin that seemingly elusive lucrative career I mentioned earlier!</p>
